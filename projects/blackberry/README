The in The Clear app suite is a set of tools for anyone working in situations 
where there is a risk of being detained and/or the phone confiscated. Mobile 
devices serve as a valuable tool for organizing and communicating, but they 
can also be used against you as incriminating evidence by technically savvy 
adversaries can be easily extracted. In the Clear allows you to automate emergency
 communications with one click and erase local personal information off your phone.
 
The application suite consists of three major features: 
 - Shout (alert your contacts via SMS)
 - Wipe (erase or hide your personal data)
 - Panic (trigger it all with a single click)
